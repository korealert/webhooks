Raygun:
    Raygun is a leading error tracking and crash reporting tool to help developers discover and resolve software bugs faster

Setting up app:
    Similar to bugsnag, just use raygun node module instead of bugsnag

Configuring Webhook:
    From dashboard go to Application settings -> integrations, provide webhook
    url, and enable it.

Events:
    When an error occurs
    Every time an error notification arrives from your app, this webhook will be
    fired. The body of the POST is JSON, and the follow is an example payload:
        {
          "event":"error_notification",
          "error": {
            "url":"http://app.raygun.io/error-url",
            "message":"",
            "firstOccurredOn":"1970-01-28T01:49:36Z",
            "lastOccurredOn":"1970-01-28T01:49:36Z",
            "usersAffected":1,
            "totalOccurrences":1
          },
          "application": {
            "name":"application name",
            "url":"http://app.raygun.io/application-url"
          }
        }
    If you'd like to see a particular webhook for an event added, contact us or add a feature request from within Raygun.
