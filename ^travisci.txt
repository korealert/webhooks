Notes:
    You will see one of the following values in the status/result fields that represent the state of the build.
    
    0: Represents a build that has completed successfully
    1: Represents a build that has not yet completed or has completed and failed
    Additionally a message will be present in the status_message/result_message fields that further describe the status of the build.
    
    Pending: A build has been requested
    Passed: The build completed successfully
    Fixed: The build completed successfully after a previously failed build
    Broken: The build completed in failure after a previously successful build
    Failed: The build is the first build for a new branch and has failed
    Still Failing: The build completed in failure after a previously failed build
    For pull requests, the type field will have the value pull_request,
    and a pull_request_number field is included
    too, pointing to the pull request's issue number on GitHub.
